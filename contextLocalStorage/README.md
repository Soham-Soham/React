# Todo List using Context API and LocalStorage

Created a simple and efficient Todo List application using React's Context API and LocalStorage. The app allows users to:

**Add Todos:** Easily add new tasks to the list.

**Delete Todos:** Remove tasks from the list with a single click.

**Update Todos:** Edit existing tasks to reflect changes.

**Toggle Completion:** Mark tasks as complete or incomplete.

The app utilizes the Context API to manage global state, ensuring seamless data flow between components. Todos are persisted locally using LocalStorage, providing data persistence even after the browser is closed.

The user interface is designed with a clean and intuitive layout, allowing users to manage their todos effortlessly. The application promotes a straightforward and user-friendly experience for effective task management.
